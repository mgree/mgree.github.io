          <h4>Working together</h4>
          <p>Research is hard work, but we cannot lose sight of the
            fact that working together is a <i>relationship</i>, which
            requires work&mdash;like any other.</p>

          <p>Our research relationship faces many challenges: power,
            knowledge, and experience are imbalanced; our goals may
            not always align; research is hard, full of dead ends and
            wrong answers.</p>

          <p>I value honesty, candor, kindness, and integrity very
            highly. I also set a high bar in research. The more we
            align in these values, the easier the working relationship
            will be.</p>
          
          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <p>I want to do good, novel research, publishing good papers
            in good venues. I also want you to learn and succeed!</p>
          <p>You want to do research, possibly for many reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To find out what research in computer science is about</li>
            <li>To solve a problem that no one has solved</li>
            <li>To sharpen your computer science skills</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It's important that I know up front what your goals
            are. If I don't know where you're looking to go, I can't
            help you get there. If we're not both headed in the same
            direction, things may or may not work out&mdash;I want to
            find that out <i>early</i>, not late!</p>

          <h4>What to do research on</h4>
          <p>I can give you a project or you can come to me with a
            project. If you bring me a project, we have to talk it
            through to make sure that it works for both of us&mdash;I
            only have expertise on/interest in certain topics.</p>

          <p>If you're hoping to go into to a PhD program, working on
            publishable research now is a critical start. Most of my
            projects are planned to publish work along the way, so
            having me give you a project may be the safest bet.</p>

          <p>The <i>best</i> research is done by people who care about
            what they're working on. Our work together will be at its
            best when we both care about the topic. We'll have to talk
            to figure it out.</p>

          <h4>How to do research</h4>
          <p>Working with me will mean meeting at least once
            a week to discuss what's been done so far and what to do
            next.</p>

          <p>Keep notes. I don't care how, but keep them. I like pen
            and paper for meetings&mdash;an open computer tempts
            distraction&mdash;but I keep concrete TODO lists on my
            computer. I also keep an 'idea' list. If a meeting is
            going too fast for you to take notes, ask others to slow
            down.</p>
          
          <p>When faced with any task, try to use your judgment: is
            the problem going to be solved by thirty minutes of
            searching online, by four hours of hacking, or by weeks of
            implementation? Quick things you can dive into, but
            complex things&mdash;coding that you can't immediately see
            the other side of&mdash;need <i>planning</i>.</p>

          <p>Examples fuel intuition. One is okay, two is nice, three
            is a pattern. Decide on running examples early, and make
            sure things keep working. Take your examples from related
            work.</p>
          
          <p>When you're not sure what to do next, speak up. I try to
            be fair with my time, but it's often the squeaky wheel
            that gets the grease. Sometimes writing up your question
            is all you need to do to answer it.</p>

          <p>When in doubt, reply all.</p>

          <h5>Tools</h5>

          <p>Write documentation: plans, comments, READMEs,
            HOWTOs. Write tests: from tiny unit tests to larger
            examples, tests keep you honest. Automate your test suite
            so that a single command can tell you that your code still
            works. Even if you're doing theory work, write tests: you
            can
            use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a>
            or <a href="https://redex.racket-lang.org/">PLT Redex</a>
            or you can roll your own.</p>
          
          <p>Use version control, specifically git. Public
            repositories on <a href="https://github.com">github</a>
            are typically okay; if not, I will tell you to use a
            specific private repository at the beginning of the
            project.</p>

          <p>Keep backups.</p>
          
          <h4>Publishing</h4>
          <p>Publishing isn't the <i>end goal</i> of research, but a
            published paper is a physical manifestation of concrete
            progress on a problem. Publishing is <i>also</i> one of
            the ways I'm evaluated as a professor; suffice to say, I
            try to publish good work frequently.</p>

          <p>I don't expect most research to turn into
            publications. If something from your research is going to
            be published, you may be able to be a
            co-author. (Co-authoring a paper now
            will <i>significantly</i> boost your chances getting into
            good PhD programs.) We'll have to talk about it. I expect
            to do the bulk of paper submission, but not necessarily
            the bulk of the writing. Writing happens in LaTeX, which I
            can teach you.</p>

          <p>Publishing in most venues in computer science means
            giving a talk. I enjoy giving talks, but would be
            delighted to let you speak instead.</p>
                    
          <h4>Research during the semester and over the summer</h4>
          <p>There are two times to do research with me: during the
            semester and during the summer. The two are quite
            different! Work during the summer is full-time research:
            in your 10 weeks
            of <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/administration/academic-dean/student-research">SURP</a>
            funding, you have no other job but research. During the
            semester, you're probably taking three other classes, each
            of which takes eight to twelve hours of your time every
            week. If you're working as an RA, you'll get paid
            according to how much you work. If you're working as part
            of an independent study, at end of a semester of research,
            I have to give you a grade!</p>

          <p>There are two factors in determining that
            grade: <i>process</i> and <i>outcome</i>. Since I don't
            expect every semester of research to have an immediate
            outcome, I weigh process quite heavily. Even if the
            research isn't done, how have you done as a
            researcher?</p>
            
          <ul>
            <li>Do you make progress between meetings?</li>
            <li>When you're stuck, can you explain where you are and
              how you got there?</li>
            <li>Can you explain your solutions to problems in plain English?</li>
            <li>Is your implementation fit to be read by another person?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>A good outcome is good, of course! There are two primary
          avenues for good outcomes:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Have you made tangible progress on the problem we're
              working on? Just failed attempts may not count for much,
              but showing <i>why</i> certain approaches won't work
              definitely does!</li>
            <li>Have you learned a new skill?</li>
          </ul>
            
          <p>Hopefully it's clear that there are multiple ways for me
            to assess your work at the end of the semester, and that
            my metric isn't "solving all of the problems".</p>

          <p>Summer work is different. While I don't need to give you
            a grade at the end of working together, my measure of what
            counts for a good outcome are the same as those
            above. Since summer research with me is your only job, I
            tend to expect more of an outcome. I have some additional
            expectations on summer work:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Unless there's a reason otherwise, I expect summer
              work to last the full ten weeks allowable.</li>
            <li>Attend weekly meetings with the group, giving feedback
              on others' work and occasionally presenting your own
              work.</li>
            <li>Spend time in the lab every work day. To quote
              Norman Ramsey: <i>part of your job is to be in the lab
                and talk with other people about your
                research</i>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Senior projects and theses</h4>
          <p>I am delighted to supervise senior projects and
            theses. If you would like me to supervise yours, come talk
            to me. My expectations for a senior project are similar to
            those of any other research over the semester... but note
            that projects and theses have even more deadlines built in
            than "end of the semester, time for grades"!</p>
          
          <h4>My responsibilities</h4>
          <p>I will provide funding: for summer research and
            R.A. salaries, but also for travel to conferences and
            workshops, materials for posters, etc. If you need
            something for research&mdash;textbooks, software,
            hardware&mdash;do not be afraid to ask.</p>

          <p>I will provide expertise and guidance on everything in
            the research process: the topic, the goals, the relevance,
            the approach, the bibliography, and of course the work
            itself.</p>

          <p>If you need to learn a skill, I will either teach it to
            you or find you resources so you can learn it.</p>

          <p>I will sign administrative forms you prepare; I will go
            to bat for you when the bureaucracy is behaving badly.</p>

          <p>I will help you with your career:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you're interested in academia, I can explain to
              you the structure of CS academia, from scientific,
              administrative, and economic points of view.</li>
            <li>I will try to find career options in whatever field
            you set your eye on.</li>
            <li>I will write you an honest letter of
              recommendation. If I can't honestly write a <i>good</i>
              recommendation, I will be up front about it.</li>
            <li>I will nominate you for awards and fellowships (as
              appropriate).</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Your responsibilities</h4>
          <p>Actually do the work. I expect that you will
            do <i>something</i> between meetings, on your own. I don't
            expect any particular level of success (though good
            outcomes are good!), but I expect, at a minimum,
            effort.</p>

          <p>Respect my and your time. Decide early on how much time
            you can commit&mdash;during the semester, you'll have to
            decide whether to do a half or whole credit of research
            quite early. If you're working for pay, rather than
            credit, decide early on how many hours a week you have to
            commit. If you need to make a change, say so before it's a
            problem.</p>
          
          <p>Ask for help when you need it. Don't ask for help before
            trying to figure it out yourself and with your peers.</p>

          <p>Let me know what's going on. Are you going to be away?
            Are you feeling unsatisfied or stuck with the problem
            you're working on? I can't help if you don't let me
            know.</p>
          
          <p>Know when your next meeting is; show up on time... or
            reschedule <i>as soon as you know you can't make
            it</i>.</p>

          <p>Do the administrative work of making sure you're getting
            appropriate credit (payment, course credit) from
            Pomona. For summer students, make sure you have housing
            set up for your dates.</p>

          <p>Give me advance notice when you need a letter of
            recommendation. Two weeks is the <i>minimum</i>; a month
            is ideal.</p>
